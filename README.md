# Web Developer Portfolio Sample

This is a sample portfolio I created during a web development workshop hosted by Zuitt BootCamp. As a beginner, I followed the tutorial and used sample content to practice and learn fundamental web development skills. It demonstrates my ability to build simple, responsive websites using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap.

## Project Overview
The website includes the following:
- **Landing Section:** A placeholder for a profile description, with a sample button.
- **Social Media Links:** Icons linking to my social media profiles.
- **Responsive Design:** Using Bootstrap, the website is designed to be mobile-friendly and adapt to various screen sizes.

## Technologies Used
- HTML5
- CSS3
- Bootstrap
- SVG Background
- FontAwesome (for social media icons)
- Google Fonts (Roboto and Montserrat)
